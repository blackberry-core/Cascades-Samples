#
# Java properties file specifying the configuration of the project template.
#
# attributes supported are:
#
#  sources - whitespace-delimited list of source files.  Order is important
#            inasmuch as the last file in the list will be opened in an
#            editor after the project has been created, unless the project
#            includes a bar-descriptor.xml file, in which case that will
#            be the file that is edited.  The last file in the list usually
#            should be the main.c or main.cpp file.
# resources - binaries which are not treated as text files and are simply copied bypassing any template engine.
#
#  libs    - whitespace-delimited list of libnames to add to the linker
#            setup
#
#  flags.compiler - for Makefile projects, the CCFLAGS to add to common.mk
#  flags.linker - for Makefile projects, the LDFLAGS to add to common.mk
#
#  path.includes  - for managed-build and Makefile projects, extra include paths.
#                   Macro names supported are QNX_TARGET and CPUVARDIR only.
#  path.libraries - for managed-build and Makefile projects, extra library paths.
#                   Macro names supported are QNX_TARGET and CPUVARDIR only.
