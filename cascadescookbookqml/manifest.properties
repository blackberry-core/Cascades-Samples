#
# Java properties file specifying the configuration of the project template.
#
# attributes supported are:
#
# sources - whitespace-delimited list of source files. Order is important
# inasmuch as the last file in the list will be opened in an
# editor after the project has been created, unless the project
# includes a bar-descriptor.xml file, in which case that will
# be the file that is edited. The last file in the list usually
# should be the main.c or main.cpp file.
# resources - binaries which are not treated as text files and are simply copied bypassing any template engine.
#
# libs - whitespace-delimited list of libnames to add to the linker
# setup
#
# flags.compiler - for Makefile projects, the CCFLAGS to add to common.mk
# flags.linker - for Makefile projects, the LDFLAGS to add to common.mk
#
# path.includes - for managed-build and Makefile projects, extra include paths.
# Macro names supported are QNX_TARGET and CPUVARDIR only.
# path.libraries - for managed-build and Makefile projects, extra library paths.
# Macro names supported are QNX_TARGET and CPUVARDIR only.
