This application demonstrates how the MapView Cascades control can be
created and used from a QML-based application.

The application contains five buttons on the left hand side. The first
three buttons change the location of the map to pre-defined cities, while
the last two change the altitude of the map. There is also a slider control
placed above (on top) of the map that also adjusts the altitude.

This example was built and tested using developer trunk 2193.

There is currently an issue such that the 3D render engine isn't correctly
linking against the OpenGL libraries. Thus, this application links in the
GLESv1_CM library. Once the render engine has resolved this issue, the
library link can be removed from the .pro file.
